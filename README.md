# I. Introduction

This is a test project to check out some Progressive Web App (PWA) techniques. A combination of [Google Code Labs](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/) and the [Mozilla Developers Documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Progressive) were used as a base for creating this test.
